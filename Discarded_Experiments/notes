Some notes which were done in preparation of milestone 3. Not important


Pre-preprocessing
- Bring into more suitable format for mne-bids-pipeline
- Remove superfluous events occuring in rapid succession

Preprocessing
- Remove ~2 breaks (15s)
- Bandpass Filter (1-40Hz)
- Epoching [-0.2,1]
- Baseline correction
- Autoreject epochs before and after ICA (7.8%)



4-16 (med. 8) Interpolated (ours)
1-3 (med. 2) Interpolated (paper)

2-7 Components 9+


- Subject Cleaning
- Re-referencing, interpolating bad electrodes
- Remove 6 most ventral electrodes
- Event epoching, segment data around key events
- Filter bad channels and epochs using FASTER
- Filter blinks and eye movement with ICA
- High-pass & Low-pass filters, baseline correction
- Time-frequency analysis 
- Normalization & ITPC Calculation




Paper
Epochs -2 to 2
Bandpass filter 0.1 - 20 Hz
Reject Epochs with FASTER (3.27%)

[chatgpt text]
Time-frequency captures both temporal and spectral information, allowing for the detection of oscillatory and transient brain activity

It can reveal both phase-locked and non-phase-locked activity, providing a more detailed view of complex cognitive processes in dynamic tasks like video games

This method also handles the inherent non-stationarity of EEG signals well, making it ideal for analyzing the flexible and variable demands of different experimental conditions.
